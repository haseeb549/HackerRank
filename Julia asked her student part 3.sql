-- QUESTION:

-- You did such a great job helping Julia with her last coding contest challenge that she wants you to work on this one, too!

-- The total score of a hacker is the sum of their maximum scores for all of the challenges. Write a query to print the hacker_id, name,
-- and total score of the hackers ordered by the descending score. If more than one hacker achieved the same total score, then sort the
-- result by ascending hacker_id. Exclude all hackers with a total score of  from your result.

-- SOLUTION:

select m.hacker_id, h.name, sum(score) as total_score 
from (
    select hacker_id, challenge_id, max(score) as score
from Submissions 
    group by hacker_id, challenge_id) as m
join Hackers as h
on 
m.hacker_id = h.hacker_id
group by m.hacker_id, h.name
having sum(score)> 0
order by total_score desc, m.hacker_id;
